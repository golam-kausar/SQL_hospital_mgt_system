# SQL_hospital_mgt_system
#### 
This project focuses on SQL-based analysis of healthcare data. It includes queries to analyze patient demographics (age, gender), hospital performance, doctor workload, and patient billing. The project explores the distribution of medical conditions, blood types, and patient admissions by date, hospital, or insurance provider. Other aspects include calculating average stay durations, recovery times based on medication or doctor, and identifying trends in admissions (weekend vs. weekday). Billing analysis is done by hospital, insurance provider, and age group, while patient readmissions and common medications are also examined.
